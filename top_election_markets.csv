The tipping point jurisdiction is defined as the jurisdiction that gives the winning candidate the necessary electoral votes to reach or surpass 270 electoral votes when states are ordered by the margin of victory. The margin of victory is the difference in the percentage of votes between the top two candidates. In this ordering, the tipping point state is the one where adding its electoral votes to the cumulative total reaches or exceeds 270 for the first time. 

The respective percentages of the vote won will be determined based on the official vote count once each listed jurisdiction has certified their votes. For purposes of this market, the jurisdiction is considered won by the candidate who wins the popular vote in that jurisdiction. Faithless electors shall have no effect on the outcome.

The resolution source for this market will be the official vote count once all the listed jurisdictions have certified their votes.

If there is a recount in any listed jurisdiction before certification, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is certified.

Otherwise, this market will resolve to ""No"".

If no candidate reaches 270 Electoral votes this market will resolve to ""Yes"".

The tipping point jurisdiction is defined as the jurisdiction that gives the winning candidate the necessary electoral votes to reach or surpass 270 electoral votes when states are ordered by the margin of victory. The margin of victory is the difference in the percentage of votes between the top two candidates. In this ordering, the tipping point state is the one where adding its electoral votes to the cumulative total reaches or exceeds 270 for the first time. 

The respective percentages of the vote won will be determined based on the official vote count once each listed jurisdiction has certified their votes. For purposes of this market, the jurisdiction is considered won by the candidate who wins the popular vote in that jurisdiction. Faithless electors shall have no effect on the outcome.

The resolution source for this market will be the official vote count once all the listed jurisdictions have certified their votes.

If there is a recount in any listed jurisdiction before certification, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is certified. If a recount occurs after certification, the recount will not be considered.","[""Yes"", ""No""]","[""0"", ""1""]",0,621404.8387,TRUE,TRUE,,2024-07-15T19:46:09.443271Z,2024-12-18T02:21:32.104777Z,FALSE,TRUE,Other,14,0x27a926dfb9aca1aee19f968414745b90ecbaf10c44313c639d69bda6b9b3cd0e,TRUE,0.001,5,621404.8387,0,,"[""53336973995332171450882896442422334093110769520030791409907835610812453116675"", ""81671491882918061800437891385059859366670986106676259620894484707982754488708""]",500,5,,621404.8387,0,FALSE,5,3.5,0.001,-0.0025,0.001,,0.001,11524,us-election-tipping-point-state,us-election-tipping-point-state,Tipping Point State in 2024 Election?,This is a market on which state will be the tipping point in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.,,26153232.58,,,TRUE,,TRUE,0x27a926dfb9aca1aee19f968414745b90ecbaf10c44313c639d69bda6b9b3cd00,128,,,

As a result, On 7 July 2022, Boris Johnson, the Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party since 2019, announced his resignation as party leader, but plans to remain as prime minister until a successor is chosen.

This market will resolve to ""Yes"" if Rishi Sunak wins the election to become the Conservative Party leader succeeding Boris Johnson. Otherwise, this market will resolve to ""No"".

The resolution of this market will be based on the first official announcement of the next permanent Conservative Party leader after Boris Johnson, as chosen by a Conservative Party leadership contest. The primary resolution source will be official government sources reporting the result of the election; however, a consensus of credible media sources will also suffice.

If the successor to Boris Johnson is not known by December 31, 2022, this market will resolve to ""No.""

This market may only resolve to ""No"" once Rishi Sunak announces he is no longer in contention for head of the Conservative Party, or the Conservative party announces Rishi Sunak is no longer in contention for head of the Conservative Party, or election results eliminate Rishi Sunak from the running for leader of the Conservative Party, or the next leader of the Conservative Party after Boris Johnson is officially selected and it is not Rishi Sunak.
